--Description--
This mod is an example mod that creates 'Hp2SampleModOutput.txt' containing "Hello world!" in the root directory on startup. It is meant to serve as an example of how a Hp2BaseMod mod is designed. Note how this mod uses the Hp2BaseMod.Interface but does not inclide it in the mod directory. Only add dll's here that aren't already in Huniepop 2's Managed folder or loaded by the base mod (like Hp2BaseMod.Interface), they're unessisary. SampleMod.cs is not needed for the mod, it is here for your benefit so you can see how this mod works. This mod should work regardless of the version of Huniepop 2 installed. If your mod references any of the libraries in Huniepop 2's Managed folder remember that your mod may not work in versions of the game other than the one it was developed in.

--To Install--
To install, first install the Hp2BaseMod and then place the entire 'SampleMod' folder in the 'mods' folder.
